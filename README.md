## What is L.o.U.I.S.?

L.o.U.I.S. (pronounced _LOO-iss_, just like the name Louis) is a collection of useful types commonly needed in the development of .NET libraries and applications.

Although nearly everybody and their pet hamster come up with their own "basic building blocks" library, L.o.U.I.S. is different because:

- the author of L.o.U.I.S. (yours truly) has been a professional software developer for more than thirty (30) years, with more than a dozen years of experience with C# and a reputation for _clean code_ that _just works_;
- L.o.U.I.S. has been used in production from day one: all my professional projects have been refactored to use it, so I'm committed to support L.o.U.I.S. and continuously improve it;
- L.o.U.I.S. is based on a collection of closed-source libraries, written and used in production over the course of seven years, which I have decided to polish up and release under an open-source license.

### What does L.o.U.I.S. mean?

Although it is pronounced (an may also be written) just as the name Louis, L.o.U.I.S. is an acronym for "Lots of Useful & Interesting Stuff". If this makes you cringe, you should see the names I discarded.

### Who is behind L.o.U.I.S.?

Glad you asked. :grin: My name is Riccardo and I've been a professional software developer since 1991. In 2015 I left a well-payed job to found my own business.

Over the course of more than 30 years, I have benefitted immensely from open-source software. Now that I am, at least partly, in control of my work time allocation, I have decided to give back as much as I can. This is why I write L.o.U.I.S.

### Meet the mascot (Louise the happy French bulldog)

See the happy French bulldog in the logo? I like to think of her as a she, actually. Her name is Louise and she's L.o.U.I.S.' mascot.

I'd like to tell you all about the massive brainstorming and astute marketing techniques that lead to the choice of Louise as a mascot, but to sum it all up: I saw her on [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com), thought _"OMG cute!"_, wanted to keep her. Louise, meet users; users, meet Louise.

## Features

L.o.U.I.S. was born to replace a number of small closed-source, internal-use libraries written over the 7 years since I became self-employed. Some of them have become obsolete; for some others I've found 3rd-party alternatives; what's left, once polished up and properly documented (at least in XML comments), became the seed from which L.o.U.I.S. blossomed.

L.o.U.I.S. also contains a bunch of new material, originally written in part for my own business projects, in part for [EmbedIO](https://github.com/unosquare/embedio).

### Third-party projects

You can find proper attributions to projects I "stole" code from in the [third-party notice file](./THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES). Here I want to mention projects that have provided, and keep providing, experience and inspiration.

- [EmbedIO](https://github.com/unosquare/embedio) has been my first experience as a collaborator to an open-source project; working on it has taught me a lot. Special thanks to @geoperez for dealing with me while I moved my first steps.
- [.NET Community Toolkit](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/dotnet) is not just an invaluable tool, but a great source of inspiration too. The idea for the `Throw` class came from their own [ThrowHelper](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/communitytoolkit/developer-tools/throwhelper), although the implementation approach is different.

### Graphic elements and fonts

You can find proper attributions for graphic elements and fonts in [the `graphics` folder](graphics/#readme).
