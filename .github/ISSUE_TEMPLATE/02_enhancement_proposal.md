If this is your first post on GitHub, or you are not familiar with GitHub-flavored Markdown, please take the time to read this guide:

GitHub also has a nice Markdown cheatsheet in PDF format:

## Current version: <!-- The version on which you are proposing an improvement -->

## Background and motivation
<!--
We welcome enhancement proposals!
This template will help us gather the information we need to discuss your proposal and possibile implementation.

This and all other XML comments are here just for your convenience and will not be shown in your post; you can delete them all before posting.

First, please describe the purpose and value of the new functionality here:
  * what problem does it solve?
  * which type(s) of projects does it affect?
  * is it specific to some configuration or toolchain?

Please include as many code snippets, CI log fragments, screenshots, etc. you deem useful to illustrate your point.
For texts spanning more than a few lines, please create a gist here https://gist.github.com/ and provide a link to it.

Don't forget to use syntax highlighting for Markdown code blocks. For example:

```XML
<Project>

  <PropertyGroup>
    <IsNicelyColored Condition="'$(HasXMLAfterTheThreeBackticks)' == 'true'">true</IsNicelyColored>
  <PropertyGroup>

</Project>
```

GitHub's syntax highlighting supports more languages that would be practical to list here.
Here's the complete list: https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/languages.yml

## Proposed enhancement

<!--
Please describe the desired behavior, i.e. _what_ should happen, not _how_ or _why_ (that belongs to the next section).
-->

## Implementation proposals

<!--
If you have an idea (or more than one) about _how_ the desired behavior can be implemented, please explain it here.
Be as detailed as your knowledge of the project allows.
Even if you don't know the project internals, feel free to speak your mind here.
Any level of detail, from "I don't know" to specific code snippets, is fine.
-->

## Usage examples

<!--
Please provide example code and/or project snippets that highlight how the proposed enhancement will affect user projects.
-->

## Risks

<!--
Please mention any risks that to your knowledge the proposed enhancement might entail:
  * breaking changes
  * performance regressions
  * security issues
  * possible incompatibilities
  * added or changed dependencies
  * etc.
-->

## Additional information

<!--
Please add any additional information you deem useful.
This section is optional. You may delete it, replace it, or add more sections, in order to better organize information.
