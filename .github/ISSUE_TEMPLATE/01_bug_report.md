This and all other XML comments are here just for your convenience and will not be shown in your post; you can delete them all before posting.

If this is your first post on GitHub, or you are not familiar with GitHub-flavored Markdown, please take the time to read this guide:
https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github

GitHub also has a nice Markdown cheatsheet in PDF format:

-->

## Current version: <!-- The version on which you are experiencing the bug -->

## Description

<!--
* Please share a clear and concise description of the problem.
* Include minimal steps to reproduce the problem if possible. E.g.: the smallest possible code snippet; or a small repo to clone, with steps to reproduce the bug.
* What behavior are you seeing? What would you expect instead?

Please include as many code snippets, CI log fragments, screenshots, etc. you deem useful to illustrate your point.
For texts spanning more than a few lines, please create a gist here https://gist.github.com/ and provide a link to it.

Don't forget to use syntax highlighting for Markdown code blocks. For example:

```XML
<Project>

  <PropertyGroup>
    <IsNicelyColored Condition="'$(HasXMLAfterTheThreeBackticks)' == 'true'">true</IsNicelyColored>
  <PropertyGroup>

</Project>
```

GitHub's syntax highlighting supports so many more languages that it would be impractical to list them all here.
Here's the complete list: https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/languages.yml

## Configuration

<!--
  * In which kind of project(s) are you experiencing the lamented behavior?
  * To your knowledge, which operating system / CPU architecture are affected?
  * Do you know whether the problem may be specific to your configuration?
  -->

## Regression?

<!--
  * Did this work in a previous release? If you can try a previous release to find out, that can help us narrow down the problem. If you don't know, that's OK.
  -->

## Other information

<!--
  * Please include any relevant information you have. Please prefer pasted text over images (so it shows up in searches).
  * If you have an idea where the problem might lie, let us know that here. Please include any pointers to code, relevant changes, or related issues you know of.
  * Do you know of any workarounds?
