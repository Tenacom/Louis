# Features

L.o.U.I.S. was born to replace a number of small closed-source, internal-use libraries written over the course of seven years. Some of them have become obsolete; for some others we've found 3rd-party alternatives. What's left, once polished up and properly documented (at least in XML comments), became the seed from which L.o.U.I.S. blossomed.

L.o.U.I.S. also contains a bunch of new material, originally written in part for Tenacom's business projects, in part for other open source projects.
