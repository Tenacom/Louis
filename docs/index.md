L.o.U.I.S. (pronounced _LOO-iss_, just like the name Louis) is a collection of useful types commonly needed in the development of .NET libraries and applications.

Although nearly everybody and their pet hamster come up with their own "basic building blocks" library, L.o.U.I.S. is different because:

- L.o.U.I.S. is backed by [Tenacom](https://github.com/Tenacom), an admittedly very small company, but totally committed to open source;
- L.o.U.I.S. has been used in production from day one: all our projects have been or are being refactored to use it. Support for L.o.U.I.S. and its continuous improvement are more than mere promises - they are business priorities;
- L.o.U.I.S. is based on a collection of closed-source libraries, written and used in production over the course of seven years, polished up and released as open source as part of Tenacom's effort to give back to the community.

## What does L.o.U.I.S. mean?

Although it is pronounced (and may also be written for brevity) just as the name Louis, L.o.U.I.S. is an acronym for "Lots of Useful & Interesting Stuff". If this makes you cringe, you should see the names we discarded.

## Who is behind L.o.U.I.S.?

[Tenacom](https://github.com/Tenacom) is a very small software house with very big ideas, founded in 2015 by [Riccardo De Agostini](https://riccar.do) a.k.a. [@rdeago](https://github.com/rdeago). We are located in North-Eastern Italy.

You will hardly find out about us on the Web; in fact, we don't even have a site. Our reputation is built exclusively on word of mouth between customers and prospects.

Our commitment to open source comes from the simple realization that without it we wouldn't even be in business. We try to give back as much as we can by open-sourcing most of our code, save only for the most business-critical pieces.

## Meet the mascot (Louise the happy French bulldog)

See the happy French bulldog in the logo? She is L.o.U.I.S.' mascot; her name is Louise.
